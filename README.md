# ðŸ“Š Census Income Classification using Logistic Regression and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

This project demonstrates how to use **Logistic Regression**, a classical and interpretable machine learning algorithm, in combination with **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to predict whether an individual earns **more than \$50,000 annually** based on their demographic and employment attributes.

The model is trained and evaluated on the **UCI Adult Census Income Dataset**, one of the most widely used real-world benchmarks for income classification tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Build a reliable, interpretable binary classification model
- Understand the relationship between features and income bracket
- Apply **RFE** to reduce dimensionality and improve performance
- Use **F1-score** to evaluate model robustness under class imbalance

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preparation

- Loaded `.data` file using `pandas.read_csv()`
- Replaced `" ?"` entries with `NaN` and removed incomplete rows
- Encoded categorical columns using `LabelEncoder`
- Normalized numerical features using `StandardScaler` for model convergence

---

## ðŸ”Ž Modeling Pipeline

### 1. Baseline Logistic Regression
- Trained on all features to establish baseline accuracy and F1-score

### 2. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Used RFE from `sklearn.feature_selection` to:
  - Rank feature importance
  - Test all subsets from 1 to 14 features
  - Evaluate each using **weighted F1-score** on test data

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Compared models by number of features and their F1-scores
- Identified optimal feature subset
- Final model trained and evaluated on selected features

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Why F1-Score?

- The dataset is slightly imbalanced (more `<=50K` than `>50K`)
- **F1-score balances precision and recall**, providing a better measure of model effectiveness than raw accuracy
- Used `average='weighted'` to account for both classes proportionally

---

## âœ… Results

- Achieved strong F1-score with fewer than all features
- Top predictors included:
  - `education-num`
  - `hours-per-week`
  - `capital-gain`
  - `occupation`
  - `age`
- Reduced dimensionality improved model generalization and interpretability
